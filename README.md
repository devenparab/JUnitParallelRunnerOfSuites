# JUnit Parallel Runner Of Suites
This is a simple WIP project with POC in way, The idea is to run the jUnit Tests paralelly one by one from different packages of tests.
The idea of this project is to run the Suite in parallel mode with the help of jUnit5 feature of parallel mode execution. 
Each Suite will run one after another but every suite is running parallely.
In order to trigger this just run the SuiteRunner.java, this will trigger all the Suites one after another.
Remember this is my WIP and hence there might be lot of unused code.
